### Hi, I'm Mira ðŸ‘‹

I am a web frontend developer, currently working for [Hit The Code](https://www.hitthecode.com/).
I began my career in IT in 2015 as a customer support representative at a hosting company, where I gained valuable experience in troubleshooting and resolving customer issues related to hosting and websites. To expand my skills and knowledge, I also actively sought out additional training and education, including courses to become a qualified web developer. Currently, I am working as a front-end developer, but I am actively working towards transitioning to full-stack development. Additionally, I am passionate about open-source development and enjoy participating in hackathons to further expand my skills and contribute to the community.

Top technologies in my stack:
- Javascript;
- Typescript;
- Web components & Lit;
- Nuxt & Vue;
- Tailwind and other;
